# Data Structures and Algorithms

I created this repository as a mean of sharing my Data Structures and Algorithms learning journey, and keeping track of my progress.

In this repository, I'll be adding all the notes taht I take from the DSA course I'm taking. I will also be adding solution to Leetcode problems that I solve.

Also learning DSA and need an accountability partner? Please, shoot me an email at [quyumkehinde@gmail.com](mailto:quyumkehinde@gmail.com)
