## Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that makes use of the "key" => "value" relationship to store a collection of data.Hash tables allow users to set the key for their value and insert them at any point in the memory, unlike arrays where we are limited to the initial length of the array and have to keep creating a new array when we add new data.

### Operations
