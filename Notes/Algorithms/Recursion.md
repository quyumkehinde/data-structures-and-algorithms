## Steps to creating a recursive function

1. Identify the base case.
2. Identify the recursive case.
3. Ensure every iteration should get us closer to the base case.

## When to consider using recursion:

1. The problem can be divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3. The solution of each sub problem can be combined to solved the problem at hand.
