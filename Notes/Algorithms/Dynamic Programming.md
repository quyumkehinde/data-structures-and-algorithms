# Dynamic Programming

It is an optimization technique. It is a programming concept that involves the breaking down of problems into sub-problems in such a way that the solution of a sub-problem can be reused.

## Memoization (caching)

Memoization is an optimization technique that makes applications more efficient and hence faster. It does this by storing computation results in cache, and retrieving that same information from the cache the next time it's needed instead of computing it again.

## Rules to determine if a problem is a DP problem

1. It can be divided into subproblem
2. It has a recursive solution
3. There are **repetitive subproblems**
