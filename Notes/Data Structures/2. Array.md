## Array

A data structure that stores data by keeping track of them using index. Arrays are stored in order (0 - n-1)

Indexes are ordered numbesr from 0 to n - 1 (where n is the number of elements in the array) that we use to keep track of each data in an array.

## Operations and time complexities.

1. Lookup: O(1) - Lookup is constant time because arrays make use of index for tracking its data.
2. Push: O(1) - Push is contant time because all that needs to be done is add the element/data to the next index of the array.
3. Insert: O(n) - Insert is *n* time because we have to move each element of the array to the next index to be able to add a new element to the first index of the array.
4. Delete: O(n) - While the time can be as small as O(1) in a best case scenario, in worst case, we will have to go through each element of the array to find the item that we want to delete.

## Types of Array

1. Static - Elements are fixed in size. Takes less memory
2. Dynamic - Elements are not fixed. Takes more memory. Insertion is O(n) as the array is usally moved to a new memory location under the hood.
