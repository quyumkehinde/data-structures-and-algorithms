## What is a Data Structure?

Data structure can be simply put as a way of organizing data in a collection.

## Operations on Data Structures

1. Insertion: Adding a new data into a data collection.
2. Deletion: Removing a data from a data collection.
3. Traversal: Accessing each data in a collection, one at a time, for processing.
4. Searching: Finding the location of a data in a collection. (sometimes we only want to know if it exist in the collection and don't care about the location).
5. Sorting: Arranging data in such an orderly manner.
6. Access: Getting a data from a collection.
