# Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Selection sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort

## 1. Bubble Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Compare and swap two node iteratively, repeat until all elements are sorted.

## 2. Insertion Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Iterate through the elements, switches the element in iteration to the left untill the value before it is smaller.

## 3. Selection Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Iterates through the elements in the array everytime to get and set the minimum value at every index in the array.
