## Graph

A Graph is a data structure that involves the representation of data in such a way that the **nodes** (elements) are connected using **edges**.

## Types of graph

### Based on direction

1. Directed graph - Movement between nodes are capped.
2. Undirected graph - Movement between nodes is fully supported.

### Based on weight

1. Weighted graph - Carries information on its edges.
2. Unweighted graph - Does not carry information on its edges.

### Based on structure

1. Cyclic graph - Its nodes/vertices are connected in a circular manner. 
2. Acyclic graph - Its node/vertices are not connected in a circular manner.
