# Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Selection sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort

## 1. Bubble Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Compare and swap two node iteratively, repeat until all elements are sorted.

## 2. Insertion Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Iterate through the elements, switches the element in iteration to the left untill the value before it is smaller.

## 3. Selection Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Iterates through the elements in the array everytime to get and set the minimum value at every index in the array.

## 4. Merge Sort

- **Time complexity - O(nlogn)**
- **Space complexity - O(n)**

Merge the element using divide and conquer. Breaks the elements recursively and merge by comparin values of the left and right side.
