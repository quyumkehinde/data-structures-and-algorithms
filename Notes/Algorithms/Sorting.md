### 1. Bubble Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)** <br>
- **Space complexity - O(1)** <br>

Compare and swap two node iteratively, repeat until all elements are sorted.

### 3. Selection Sort

- **Time complexity - O(n^2)**
- **Space complexity - O(1)**

Iterates through the elements in the array everytime to get and set the minimum value at every index in the array.
